* For semantic segmentation, please use DeepLabV3 from gluon :https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/model_zoo/segmentation.html.
* For neural style transfer, please use: https://github.com/CortexFoundation/StyleTransferTrilogy which contains the code for one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many transfer. During our experiments, although the one-to-one manner is time-consuming, it is the most accurate way to perform style transfer on cardiac MR images.
